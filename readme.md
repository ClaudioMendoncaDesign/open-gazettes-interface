# Open Gazettes Interface - Alpha

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` in the project directory, to install all the gulp dependencies

Run `gulp watch` to start task manager. Gulp should take care of mostly everything.

NPM only manages the Gulp Dependencies. It is not used to manage the front-end dependencies.
